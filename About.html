            The band's North American tour, The Good Times Only Tour, was scheduled to commence in June 2022,

            However, on July 6, exactly three weeks before the tour's first show, the band announced that 
            due to ongoing legal battles with their former management, they would be cancelling the tour and 
            going on a hiatus.
